	- Create radio buttons for question category and score rule options.
	- Display descriptions on home.html when a user selects a radio button for score rule options.
	If the customized score rule option is selected, a number input field (# of points to
	deduct for wrong answers) will pop up.
	- Create a text input field that requires the user to add at least two team names.
	On home.html, users can add team name with "Add" button and delete team names with "X" button
	- Add descriptions of HTML form elements (data type, info that is stored) in __init__.py
	- Update main.css with styles for home.html

	- In home.html, removed the required attributes of input fields because they caused console errors and customizing
	pop-up messages prevented HTML form from getting submitted regardless of whether the user followed instructions.
	Instead, I added validate() function in events.js to make sure the user selects exactly five question 			categories and one score rule option. validate() also checks that the user adds at least two team names. If those 	  conditions aren't met, alert messages pop up and the HTML form isn't submitted.
	- Add instructions above input fields in home.html

	scores, selected team, submitted answer
	- Use Jinja and json.dumps() to connect variables from __init__.py to questions.html's JS functions:
		-check if a card's question has already been answered 
		-prevent clicks on answered cards from navigating page to question.html
	- Add HTML form elements in question.html to display multiple choice trivia questions and store
	the team name answering the question and the submitted answer
	- Create card.css: contains CSS for question.html
	- Center Jeopardy board by adjusting margins, padding, float, and other attributes in board.css
